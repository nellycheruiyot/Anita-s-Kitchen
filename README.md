## Demo
Here is a working live demo :  [github link]

## Features
-  Hover effect for the **breakfast, lunch and dinner ** sections such that on hover they are covered by a layer of white as shown by the lunch section and their fonts are turned to black from white.
 - The Hamburger menu represented by the 3 horizontal lines when clicked opens a full screen menu that has the following menu items that all hyperlink to '#':
       a. contacts
       b. events
       c. menu
 - The **full screen menu (above)** is of colour `#F15A29` and **the text of the menu items black in colour**
 - The full screen menu uses jQuery to toggle the menu options when clicked
 - When the user provides a subscription email at the bottom of the page, tells the user that he/she has been subscribed by showing the email and a message. For example:
  ** johndoe@abc.com has been successfully added to our email list. Thank you. **
  - This is done using JavaScript forms and jQuery to capture user input and send back an alert
